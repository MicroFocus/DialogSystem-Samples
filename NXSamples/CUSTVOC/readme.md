# Dialog System CUSTVOC sample

This sample is the original CUSTVOC sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how you can embed Dialog System functions
within a COBOL program.
CUSTVOC is a re-working of the CUSTOMER Dialog System demo.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open CUSTVOC.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
