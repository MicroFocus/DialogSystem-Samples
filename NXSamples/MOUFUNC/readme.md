# Dialog System MOUFUNC sample

This sample is the original MOUFUNC sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how to use mouse activated features such as
MOUSE-OVER and context menus. It also demonstrates hiding and showing
objects.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open MOUFUNC.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l MOUFUNC' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
