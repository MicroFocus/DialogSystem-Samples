# Dialog System ENTRIES sample

This sample is the original ENTRIES sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. 

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open ENTRIES.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
