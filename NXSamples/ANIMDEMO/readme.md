# Dialog System ANIMDEMO sample

This sample is the original ANIMDEMO sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how bitmaps and bitmapped push buttons can
be animated to improve the visual feedback of a user interface.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open ANIMDEMO.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
