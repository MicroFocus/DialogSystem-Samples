# Dialog System DSOLE Extension

This sample is the original DSOLE sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It illustrates the use of the DSOLE Dialog System 
Extension(DSX), together with the OLE control and OLE-UPDATED events to maintain 
and use COM objects in your Dialog System application.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open DSOLE.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l DSOLE' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
