# Dialog System ROUTER sample

This sample is the original ROUTER sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how to use multiple screensets with Dialog
System in an environment which does not have the ability to run
subprograms concurrently.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open ROUTER.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
