# Dialog System OBJECTS sample

This sample is the original OBJECTS sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows an example of most of the objects that
may be created using Dialog System.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open OBJECTS.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
