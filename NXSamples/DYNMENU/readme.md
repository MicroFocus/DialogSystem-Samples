# Dialog System DYNMENU sample

This sample is the original DYNMENU sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how a medium-sized menu bar can be
be maintained dynamically at run time.

1. Open DYNMENU.sln.

3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l DYNMENU' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
