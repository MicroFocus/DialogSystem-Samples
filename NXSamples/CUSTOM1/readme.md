# Dialog System CUSTOM1 sample

This sample is the original CUSTOM1 sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is is a modified version of the CUSTOMER
example program. It has been enhanced to show how multiple instances
of screensets may be created.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open CUSTOM1.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
