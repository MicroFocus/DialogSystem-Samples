# Dialog System WebBrowser ActiveX Control

This sample is the original Explorer sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of using ActiveX controls to extend
Dialog System functionality.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open Explorer.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
