# Dialog System VIEWDEMO sample

This sample is the original VIEWDEMO sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. The sample shows the capabilities of the DSBROWSE
Dialog System Extension. The DSBROWSE extension provides the ability
to review plain text files from within Dialog System applications,
without the need for the user to write any COBOL code. The DSBROWSE
extension is accessed by means of the CALLOUT function in Dialog System.
