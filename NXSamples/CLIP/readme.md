# Dialog System CLIP sample

This sample is the original CLIP sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how you can use Panels Version 2 to
provide clipboard functionality within Dialog System.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open CLIP.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
