# Dialog System CNRDEMO sample

This sample is the original CNRDEMO sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how you can use the Container Dialog
System Extension.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open CNRDEMO.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l CNRDEMO' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
