# Dialog System DSMDI sample

This sample is the original DSMDI sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. The example shows how you can create a Multiple Document Interface (MDI)
frame window using the Dialog System extension DSMDI.  All child windows of the
MDI frame will be MDI children, and may be used for Tile/Cascade/Arrange Icons 
functionality.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open DSMDI.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l DSMDI' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
