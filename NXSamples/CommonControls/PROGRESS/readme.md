# Dialog System Progress Bar Control

This sample is the original PROGRESS sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of how to use a
control program to add a Progress Bar control to your Dialog System
application.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open PROGRESS.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
