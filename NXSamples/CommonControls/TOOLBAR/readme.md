# Dialog System Toolbar Control

This sample is the original TOOLBAR sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of how a class 
library menu bar and toolbar can be added to your Dialog System 
application using a user control.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open TBAR.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l TBARDS' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
