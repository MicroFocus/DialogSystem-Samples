# Dialog System Using Native Tooltips

This sample is the original TOOLTIPS sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It illustrates how to use native win32 tooltips with
Dialog System applications.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open TOOLTIP.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
