# Dialog System Spin Button Control

This sample is the original SPINBUTTON sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of how to use the 
control template SPINBTN.CBL to add a spin button control object to
your Dialog System application.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open SPINBTN.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l SPINDS' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
