# Dialog System Date and Time Picker controls

This sample is the original DATETIME sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It illustrates how to use the Date and Time Picker common
controls with Dialog System applications.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open DATETIME.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
