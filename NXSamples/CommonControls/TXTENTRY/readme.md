# Dialog System Text Entry Control

This sample is the original ENTRYFIELD sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of how to use a
control program to add a Text Entry (Entry Field) control to your
Dialog System application.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open ENTRYFIELD.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
