# Dialog System SIZETEST sample

This sample is the original SIZETEST sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how you can create Dialog System windows and their
gadgets which at runtime are resized appropriate to the current resolution.

1. Open SIZETEST.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l SIZETEST' in the Command line arguments.
