# Dialog System MOUDEMO sample

This sample is the original MOUDEMO sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It demonstrates the setting of the mouse
pointer to user defined shapes and the displaying of simple bitmaps.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open MOUDEMO.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
