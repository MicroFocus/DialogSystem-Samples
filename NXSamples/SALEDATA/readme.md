# Dialog System SALEDATA sample

This sample is the original SALEDATA sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. This application provides a demonstration of simple list box handling.
Using an existing file the application loads a set of sales data to a
list box and allows you to Update (Insert, Change, Delete) entries or 
view the set of data in different sort orders.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open SALEDATA.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
