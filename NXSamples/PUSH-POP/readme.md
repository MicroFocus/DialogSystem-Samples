# Dialog System PUSH-POP sample

This sample is the original PUSH-POP sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how to push and pop screensets on the
desktop, so that multiple screensets can be visible at any one time.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open PUSH-POP.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
