# Native class library GUI sample

This sample is the original GUISAMP sample that was supplied with Net Express.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It demonstrates the use of various GUI controls
and how to code them.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open GUISAMP.sln.
2. Select TRIGGER as the startup project.
3. Start debugging.
