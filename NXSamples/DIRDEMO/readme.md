# Dialog System DIRDEMO sample

This sample is the original DIRDEMO sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It shows how to use the DSDIR Dialog System
extension. It shows how to use the file open or save dialogs to
choose a file name and return it to the calling screenset.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open DIRDEMO.sln.
2. Select Start external program on the Debug property page.
3. Select dsrunner.exe from your product installation.
4. Type '/l DIRDEMO' in the Command line arguments.
5. Start debugging.
