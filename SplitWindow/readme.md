# Split Window</name>

This sample is the original SplitWindow sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of using the GUI class library to extend
Dialog System functionality.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:

1. Open SplitWindow.sln.
2. Build and run the application.
