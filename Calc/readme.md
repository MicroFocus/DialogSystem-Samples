# Calculator

This sample is the original DSCALC sample that was supplied with Dialog System.
All that has been changed is the creation of a Visual COBOL project to replace
the Net Express project. It is an example of using dsrunner and the Dialog System
CALLOUT instruction to execute the application code.

## How to Run the Sample

To run this sample in Visual Studio:
1. Open Calc.sln.
2. Build the application.
3. Right-click DSCALC.GS and click 'Run...'
4. Alternatively, edit the project properties and go to the Debug page. Set 
   'Start external program' to dsrunner.exe, and set 'Command line arguments'
   to dscalc.gs. Note, dsrunner.exe is installed in the product bin directory.</step>
